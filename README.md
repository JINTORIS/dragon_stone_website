The main objective is that everything should be called from the Server.
It’s all going to be collected from the Server  / database meaning supposedly when the user adds a  product for every page
It should  be dynamic through PHP collecting the products from the database/server.(currently all my php files are connected)
I’m using XAMPP therefore have to access it through my PHp admin.
Aligning going from next page to next to next.
Shop now, cart - login/register - checkout- 
I’m not as familiar with this  PHp.
I need you with this , then eventually ensuring it’s out tested, bug free & out on a web-host for production.
